# xstate-traffic-light

This simple web application simulates a set of traffic lights using the XState library. The traffic lights transition between "green," "yellow," and "red" states, and you can manually cycle through them by clicking the "Next" button.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a straightforward example of using XState to manage state transitions in a web application. It serves as a starting point for those interested in learning how to implement finite state machines for simple scenarios.

Feel free to explore the code for a basic understanding of how XState works in a real-world scenario.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the project.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. Click the "Next" button to see the traffic lights change states.
